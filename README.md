# Chirpy

This is not, in fact, a real project, but instead a guided project created
through a [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course.

It's supposed to be a faux social media where you can create a user, log in,
create *Chirps* and then list them all. Including capacities to filter and sort
them. It's kinda nice.
